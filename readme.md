# Forecasting Covid-19 Cases
### By: Jagandeep Singh

## Introduction
In this project, my objective is to forecast number of Covid-19 cases in United States. Covid-19 has taken the world by storm after first  being reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then there is an exponential growth in number of cases around the world. Out of all the countries in the world, United States was hit hard. US has the highest number of cases and deaths in the world. In this project, I am going to perform time series forecasting on the number of cases to predict number of cases for next 7 days.

## Data
I am using two datasets for this project. First is the NY Times's ongoing data repository. They have data on number of cases and deaths in United States, States and Counties.

Second dataset I am using is Google's Community Mobility Reports. The reports chart movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.
